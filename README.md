X-TERMINATOR is a simple, fast-paced, and addictively fun 2D Java game.

It was created in just one week for a game jam, as part of an internship selection process. The theme of the jam was "3 Rules".

This is my first-ever game, and I'm excited to share it!

Please note that it's currently under review, so Iâ€™m unable to make any updates or improvements until the review process is complete.

Hope you enjoy playing it!
