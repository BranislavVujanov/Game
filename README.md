X-TERMINATOR is a simple, fast, and addictively fun java 2D game.

Made for a game jam as a part of selection process for intership.

My first game ever, made in a week.

As it is currently under review process, I am not allowed to refine it, so it will have to wait untill the review process is finished.

HOPE U ENJOY IT
